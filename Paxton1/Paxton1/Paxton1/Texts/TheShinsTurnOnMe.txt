"Turn On Me"

You can fake it for a while,
Bite your tongue and smile,
Like every mother does her ugly child.
But the stars are leaking out,
Like spittle from a cloud,
Amassed resentment pelting ounce and pound.

You're entertaining any doubts
'Cause you had to know that I was fond of you,
Fond of Y-O-U,
Though I knew you masked your disdain.
I can see that change was just too hard for us,
Hard for us.
You always had to hold the reins,
But where I'm headed, you just don't know the way.

So affections fade away,
And do adults just learn to play
The most ridiculous, repulsive games?
All our favorite ruddy sons,
And their double-barreled guns,
You'd better hurry,
Rabbit, run, run, run.
'Cause mincing you is fun,
And there's a lot of hungry hatters in this one cell.
We're taking it over,
Their brittle, thorny stems,
They break before they bend,
And neither one of us is one of them.

And the tears will never mend,
'Cause you had it in for me so long ago.
Boy, I still don't know,
I don't know why and I don't care,
Well, hardly anymore,
If you'd only seen yourself hating me.
Hating me,
When I've been so much more than fair.
But then you had to lay those feelings bare,
One thing I know still got you scared,
You're all that cold ire,
And never once erred on a dare.

You had to know that I was fond of you,
Fond of Y-O-U.
So I took your licks at the time,
And to change like that is just so hard to do,
Hard to do.
Don't let it whip-crack your life,
And I'll bow out from the fight,
Those old pious sisters were right
The worst part is over,
Now, get back on that horse and ride.
